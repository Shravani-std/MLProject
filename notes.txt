Steps:

0. Created env
1. made setup file
2. requirements.txt file
3. Run files
4. Made SRC folder + added __init__.py file
5. Components folder + added __init__.py file
6. three files in Components
7. Pipe line folder inside src + added __init__.py file
8. Two files = 1. training 2. prediction
9. in scr, made three new files = logger, exception,utils
        1. Exception.py: Modify
        2. Logger.py: Modify
10. Getting started with problem statement

problem statement: This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) 
                  is affected by other variables such as gender, Ethinicity,
                   parental level of education, Lunch and test preparation.
11. Notebook:

                1. Data Collection
                2. Import Data and required Libraries
                3. Import csv data as pandas dataframe
                4. Show top 5
                5. shape of dataset
                6. Dataset Information
                7. Data check performance:
                                        Missing Values
                                        Duplicates
                                        data types
                                        the no. of unique values of each Column
                                        Statistics of dataset 
                                        various categories present in the different categorical column
                8. Exploring data
                9. add columns for total score and average
                10. Exploring data ( Visualization )
                11. Handling Numerical and categorical values
                13. train model
                14. Evaluate
                15. See Accuracy

12. Data ingestion : Reading data from database and spliting it into train test,etc.
13. Data Transformation : Feature engineering, cleaning data, handling numeric and categorical data,etc.
14. model_trainer.py : made model.pkl file
15. run three files together using data_ingestion.py and it'll make new folder name articacts and in that preprocessor.pkl and model.pkl file will be there as well train and test files
16. also in loggs folder all logs will be saves 
17. Make prediction_pipeline 
18. make app.py connect it with prediction and also make html file and connect all three of them
19. make new folder for deployment purpose name .ebextension in that python.config will be there
20. make new application .py for deploy purpose and copy paste all app.py code
